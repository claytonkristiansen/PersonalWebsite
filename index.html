                        <p><br><br> Howdy, my name is Clayton, and I am currently studying computer engineering in my third year at Texas A&M University. <br></br>
                            I discovered my passion for writing code in high school and have only widened my appreciation since. I am skilled in 
                            many programming languages including Python, Java, Javascript, C#, C++, and Verilog, and enjoy working with any of them 
                            to solve complex problems. My current focus is on machine learning technology. My research team and I are using LSTM and 
                            RNN machine learning algorithms to find new plant-based supercapacitor electrolytes. I am also currently taking the machine 
                            learning course here on campus. <br></br>
                            I am looking to become a software engineer working on either data analytics, application development, or systems development. 
                            With my machine learning and Python experience, I will be able to write algorithms to make useful inferences about data. With 
                            my experience in electrical courses as well as computer science courses, I have a deeper understanding of how computers work. 
                            This will enable me to approach software development with the performance of each unique type of computer in mind. <br></br>
                            In the workplace, I believe that my skill in the technical realm will pair well with my ability to work with other people. 
                            I have been a leader on campus through the Christian Engineering Leaders (CEL) club since my sophomore year. With CEL I have 
                            had the opportunity to plan monthly leadership development activities and manage a large team of fellow engineers. This last 
                            summer I also took an internship with the SEC Directed Internship at Texas A&M. Here I had the privilege of leading a team of 
                            5 individuals to develop new technologies for finding the perfect fit while shopping for clothes online. I look forward to both 
                            working on and leading the development of projects, and I am excited to have the opportunity to find a job doing what I love. <br></br>
