                    <p>In addition, I am familiar with LSTM and RNN machine learning models and am currently working on a research team that is employing these technologies.</p>

                    <p>My current area of interest in Computer Engineering is machine learning. I find this field to be incredibly intersting and terrifying at the same time. The fact that they are developing neural net models based on the idea of neurons in a brain is mind-blowing.</p>
                    <p>I am also interesting in digital design and will likely be pursuing an internship with Texas Instruments doing so this summer. I like this as well because it is a pure logical art which required intensly creative problem solving.</p>
